Inheritance in Interface in Java
================================

Just like the blueprint for a class can be extended from and existing class, the interfaces can also be extended from one or more existing interfaces.
The interitance of classes allow extending from a single class, whereas in case of interfaces, multiple interfaces can be inherited to a new interface.
